score.dom.theater
*****************

.. _js_dom_theater:

This module implements a very simple DOM management engine in Javascript. All
examples in this documentation will refer to the following example scenario,
where you can edit bloggers and articles on the same page without reloading the
page::

    <div id="main"> <!-- the stage -->
        <div id="blogger"> <!-- a scene -->
            <form>
                <input name="name"/>
                <select name="origin"></select>
            </form>
        </div>
        <div id="article"> <!-- another scene -->
            <form>
                <input name="title"/>
                <textarea name="text"></textarea>
            </form>
        </div>
    </div>

A *stage* is a prominent DOM node that can present various *scenes*.

A *scene* is one of multiple user interfaces on a given stage.

Initialization
==============

All scenes managed by this module have a stage object, which holds a number
of scenes. The stage object makes sure that only one object is active at a
time and calls all appropriate functions on the scene objects::

    var stage = new score.dom.theater.Stage(score.dom('#main'));

After defining a stage, you can create specific scenes for it::

    var bloggerScene = new score.dom.theater.Scene(stage, 'blogger', document.getElementById('blogger'));

The scenes can then be activated through the stage object, or the individual
objects. The following lines are thus equivalent::

    stage.show('blogger');
    /* is the same as */
    stage.show(bloggerScene);
    /* is the same as */
    bloggerScene.show();

Configuration
=============

The scenes have various functions, which will be called automatically by
the stage.

_init
-----

Will be called just once to initialize the scene. This routine might
fetch any data from the server that is a.) not expected to change during the
runtime and b.) not related to any specific data that might be rendered. This
function must return a promise object, if it performs an asynchronous
operation.

Example for our user editor::

    bloggerScene._init = function() {
        var country = this.node.find('select[name="origin"]');
        return score.ajax('/list/countries', function(data) {
            data = JSON.parse(data);
            for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
                var option = document.createElement('option');
                option.setAttribute('value', data[i][0]);
                option.textContent = data[i][1];
                country.appendChild(option);
            }
        });
    };

_load
-----

This function will be called when the scene is expected to display a new
data set. All arguments to the ``show()``-Function will be passed here as
well.

Example for our user editor::

    bloggerScene._show = function(id) {
        var self = this;
        return score.ajax('/data/user?id=' + id, function(data) {
            self.data = JSON.parse(data);
            self.data.changed = false;
            self.node.find('input[name="name"]')[0].value = self.data.name;
        });
    };

Our modified code needs a different call to ``show()``. If we wanted to load
the editor for the user with the id 15, we could call either of the following::

    stage.show('blogger', 15);
    /* is the same as */
    stage.show(bloggerScene, 15);
    /* is the same as */
    bloggerScene.show(15);

_activate
---------

This function is called whenever the scene needs to be rendered. This is
the intended place for the scene to verify its integrity or check other
constraints before being shown. This function does not receive any parameters.

Example for our user editor::

    bloggerScene._activate = function() {
        if (this.data.changed) {
            this.data.changed = false;
            this.node.find('input[name="name"]')[0].value = data.name;
        }
    };

_deactivate
-----------

This function is called when the scene is replaced by another scene,
i.e. whenever the user navigates to a different scene in the same stage.

Example for our user editor::

    bloggerScene._deactivate = function() {
        if (this.data.changed && askIfStore()) {
            this.store();
            this.data.changed = false;
        }
    };

Events
======

The scene objects support events for each of the above function
definitions:

- ``init``
- ``load``
- ``activate``
- ``deactivate``
